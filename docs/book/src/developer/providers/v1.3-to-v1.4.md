## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

-

### Removals

- `clusterctl backup` has been removed.
- `api/v1beta1.MachineHealthCheckSuccededCondition` condition type has been removed.
- `controller/external/util.CloneTemplate` and `controllers/external/util.CloneTemplateInput` has been removed.

### API Changes

- `Backup(options BackupOptions) error` in the Client interface has been removed.

### Other

- `clusterctl upgrade apply` no longer requires a namespace when updating providers. It is now optional and in a future release it will be deprecated. The new syntax is `[namespace/]provider:version`.
- `WatchDeploymentLogs` is changed to `WatchDeploymentLogsByName`, it works same as before. Another function `WatchDeploymentLogsByLabelSelector` is added to stream logs of deployment by label selector.
- Cluster API controllers are now using an explicit security context by default.

### Suggested changes for providers

- Providers should add an explicit security context to their controllers deployment, see [#7831](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/7831) for reference.
